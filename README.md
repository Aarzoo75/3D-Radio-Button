# 3D Radio Buttons
This is a simple HTML and CSS project that demonstrates the concept of 3D radio buttons using HTML labels and CSS styles. With these 3D radio buttons, you can select different signal types: AM, FM, and AUX. The selected signal type is highlighted with a 3D effect.

## How It Works
This project utilizes HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing 3D effect for radio buttons. Here's how it works:

* Three radio input elements are used for AM, FM, and AUX signals.
* Labels are associated with each radio input to create custom-styled buttons.
* CSS is used to create a 3D effect on the buttons, giving them a cuboid appearance.
* When a radio button is checked, it triggers a CSS transition to move the selected button forward and change its appearance.
* Hovering over the buttons also triggers a 3D effect.
  
## Technologies Used
* HTML: The structure of the radio buttons and their labels.
* CSS: The styling and 3D effects applied to the radio buttons.
  
## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the HTML and CSS files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
   
## Customization
You can customize this project by modifying the CSS variables in the style.css file. You can change the colors, dimensions, and other visual aspects to fit your design preferences.

```css
/* Example CSS variable customization */
.cuboid {
  --height: 3;
  --width: 10;
  --depth: 10;
  --hue: 220;
  --sat: 20%;
  /* Customize these variables to change the appearance of the buttons */
}
```
